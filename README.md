I have hands-on experience designing robust **server-side architecture**, building APIs (**REST, GraphQL, gRPC**), working with relational & non-relational databases, and setting up **CI/CD pipelines**.  

I put strong emphasis on **code quality, architectural decisions, and performance** — continuously looking for ways to improve systems and processes.
